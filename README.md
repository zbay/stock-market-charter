Chart the stock market at https://stock-market-charter.herokuapp.com/!

Using AngularJS 1 and Web Sockets, with MongoDB in a NodeJS environment, I allow users to track whatever stocks they like, using quandl.com's free data set and API.

You can add stocks, delete stocks, and view a custom time range.
